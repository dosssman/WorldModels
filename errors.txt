With conda envirnoment

# System Dependicies installation
  Centos 7.2
  sudo yum install cmake swig zlib zlib-devel python-opengl xorg-x11-server-Xvfb xorg-x11-server-Xephyr
  - Skip virtualenv since using Conda

# Conda dependencies installation
  - First install compiler dependencies(?)
    - conda install --yes gcc_linux-64
    - conda install --yes gxx_linux-64

  Execute following script in bash
  while read requirement; do conda install --yes $requirement; done < conda-requirements.txt

# Pip dependencies install
  - pip install -r pip-requirements.txt --ignored-installed
  ( Should ignore the packages installed by Conda)

# Random Notes
- Python build failed for Box2D
  - Installed gcc_linux-64 and gxx_linux-64 before pip install box2d
  ( Did both out of lazyness to find which one is actually required)

- Python build failed for mpi4py
  - conda install -c anaconda mpi4py
  ( Same as Box2d)

- Python build failed for pybullet
  - pip install pybullet
  (May be related to Box2D error, or version error)

# Box2D Error when generating rollouts
  -> pip install box2d-kengz
  ( Already included in requirements.txt from now on)
